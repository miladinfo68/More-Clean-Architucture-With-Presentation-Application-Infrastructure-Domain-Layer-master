1- 10 000 000 recods fetched in less than 2.5m
2- I prefer use dapper why it's faster than Ef
3- Ef is good to feching data when we dont take care tracking the entity state
4- I use clean architure ,but I could put whole layers in webapi
5- type of reference among layers, ligicaly  UI--->App--->Infra---->Db

6- to Bulk insert data in sql we can use physical path of .txt or .csv but I believe my solution is even better than that
7- i did mapping object by reflection but it seems was a little bit lazy so i decided use Expression instead

Hope to see you soon bro
